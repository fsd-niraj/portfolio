# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio.

Feel free to clone/fork and make your own portfolio out of this.

## Local Setup
I'm using React, TypeScript, and Mantine UI as my UI Framewrok.
### Installing dependencies
`npm install`

### Starting development server
`npm run dev`

This should get you up and running a frontend web application on `http://localhost:5173`
